# AdventureWorksDemo
Demo of a system connecting to the Microsofts demo database AdventureWorks.
This project will provide a Restful API to conenct to the database along with tests.

At the moment this is only the API with no security or front end.  
I plan to implement these at a later date.
I will try to use the latest features of the .net environment, although I will inveitable miss some.
