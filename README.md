# AdventureWorksDemo
Demo of a system connecting to the Microsofts demo database AdventureWorks.  
This project will provide a Restful API to connect to the database along with tests.  
This project is meant as a proving ground for ideas and as a reminder of how to implement clean code/ design practices etc...  
  
I will inevitably get some of these ideas wrong, so please point me in the right direction.  

While I am concentrating on getting the basics in place, then I am foccusing on the ProductCategory table.


## Testing
#### Standard TDD testing
For standard TDD testing this project will use nUnit.  
#### Integration testing
For integration testing this project will use the SpecFlow replacment [reqnroll](https://reqnroll.net/).  
It will also require a database and access to docker.
